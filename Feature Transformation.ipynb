    "Reason: Some models are sensitive to the scale of data, and different scales can affect performance.\n",

    "# Dimensionality Reduction:\n",
    "Reduce the number of features while keeping important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason: Fewer features can make models faster and prevent overfitting (when models become too specific to the training data).\n",

    "Fill in missing data to make the model more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason: Missing data can affect model accuracy, and filling it ensures the model works with complete information."
